#Title : A Research Study on Accessibility Implementation in SwiftUI

Application:-
In my SwiftUI application, I've integrated various accessibility modifiers to improve usability for all users. These modifiers include-
.accessibilityLabel
.accessibilityValue
.accessibilityHint
.accessibilityAction


with reference to the official swift documentation

accessibilityLabel
A succinct label in a localized string that identifies the accessibility element.

accessibilityValue
A localized string that contains the value of the accessibility element.

accessibilityHint
A localized string that contains a brief description of the result of performing an action on the accessibility element.

accessibilityAction(_:_:)
Adds an accessibility action to the view. Actions allow assistive technologies, such as the VoiceOver, to interact with the view by invoking the action.



Research:-

AccessibilityChildBehavior
Defines the behavior for the child elements of the new parent element.

static let combine: AccessibilityChildBehavior - Any child accessibility element’s properties are  merged into the new accessibility element.
static let contain: AccessibilityChildBehavior - Any child accessibility elements become children of the new accessibility element.
static let ignore: AccessibilityChildBehavior - Any child accessibility elements become hidden.

accessibilityIdentifier(_:) - Uses the string you specify to identify the view.
accessibilityHidden(_:) - Specifies whether to hide this view from system accessibility features

AccessibilityTechnologies - 
static var switchControl: 
The value that represents a Switch Control, allowing the use of the entire system using controller buttons, a breath-controlled switch or similar hardware.
static var voiceOver: 
The value that represents the VoiceOver screen reader, allowing use of the system without seeing the screen visually.
Creating a technology type - init()
Creates a new accessibility technologies structure with an empy accessibility technology set.



Conclusion: In conclusion, by exploring Swift Documentation and trying things out, I’ve learned a lot about making SwiftUI apps accessible.
